# MinigameHandler
Is a basic handling plugin for minigames. This should be done on a Spigot server, and is for minigames that are based per world.

Minigames can be created and assigned for multiple worlds. Each world can have different settings, along with it's own scripts. Scripts are run dynamically so you don't have to put the minigames in the source code and compile it, and are in js format.

Very much a WIP. Last update: 11/07/17 (DD/MM/YY)
